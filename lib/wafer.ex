  Welcome to Wafer. The funkiest way to write hardware drivers.

  This library doesn't do much on it's own, it is used to help with some of the
  repetitive tasks of writing drivers for hardware peripherals such as I2C and
  SPI connected sensors.

  Wafer works with both ElixirALE and Circuits.  As such it's up to you to
  define which dependency you're using.
